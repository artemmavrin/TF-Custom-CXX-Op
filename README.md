**This Repo Is Under Construction**

This is an example of how to create a custom TensorFlow op in C++ and use it in Python.

The op implemented here is the [logit function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logit), `logit(x)=log(x/(1-x))` component-wise for `x` with entries between 0 and 1 (inclusive).
This is the inverse of the sigmoid function, and can be used to turn a probability into a score (the log odds) between `-inf` and `inf`.
The logit function is currently not implemented as a native TensorFlow op (a NumPy ndarray ufunc version exists in SciPy as [`scipy.special.logit`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.special.logit.html)). 

## Usage

Clone this repo and run `make`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/artemmavrin/TF-Custom-CXX-Op.git
cd TF-Custom-CXX-Op
# Optional but recommended: create and activate a new Python virtual environment
make
```

Running `make` will download the required Python packages and compile [`logit.cc`](logit.cc) into the shared library file `_logit.so`.
This shared library is loaded by [`logit.py`](logit.py) to expose the op in Python.
Running `make` also runs the unit tests in [`logit_test.py`](logit_test.py).

Using the `logit` TensorFlow op in Python is then easy.
For example, in a Python REPL:

```python
>>> from logit import logit
>>> logit(0.5)  # Accepts a tensor of any shape
<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=0.0>
```

## TODO

- [ ] Add documentation.
- [x] Test on Linux.
- [ ] Test on Windows.
- [ ] Create pip-installable package.
- [ ] Register gradient directly in C++.
- [ ] Make a GPU op.
